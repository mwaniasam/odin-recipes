    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This 4-ingredient orange chicken made with frozen chicken tenders is great for <br>
        when you’re craving takeout. It’s so simple to make at home, is very budget- <br>
        friendly, and only takes 4 ingredients. I serve it over rice, topped with green <br>
        onions and sesame seeds.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup orange marmalade</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Kansas City-style BBQ sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 (1 pound) bag frozen fully cooked chicken <br>
            nuggets
        </li>
        <li>sliced green onions (optional)</li>
        <li>sesame seeds (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place frozen nuggets in a <br>
            single layer on a baking sheet.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until hot and crispy, 11 to 13 minutes, or <br>
            according to package directions.
        </li>

        <li>
            Meanwhile, whisk marmalade, BBQ sauce, and soy sauce together in a small <br>
            saucepan and heat over low heat until hot, about 5 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Place nuggets in a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over the top. Toss to coat.
        </li>
    </ol>
