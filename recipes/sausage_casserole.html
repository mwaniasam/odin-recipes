    <h1>Sausage Casserole Recipe</h1>

    <img src="../images/sausage_caserole.webp" alt="">

    <p>This savory sausage breakfast casserole with hash brown potatoes, <br>
        green onions, and cheese is easy to put together and perfect for a hearty breakfast or <br>
        weekend brunch. You can cook the sausage and green onions in a cast-iron <br>
        skillet, and use that to bake the casserole instead of a baking dish.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package bulk breakfast sausage</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package hash brown potatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>6 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 (2.64 ounce) package country gravy mix</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground paprika, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease an 8x11-inch baking <br>
            dish.
        </li>

        <li>
            Cook and stir breakfast sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and <br>
            crumbly, about 10 minutes; drain excess grease.
        </li>

        <li>
            Mix green onion into the sausage and spread into the bottom of the prepared <br>
            baking dish.
        </li>

        <li>
            Spread hash brown potatoes in a layer over top; sprinkle with Cheddar cheese.
        </li>

        <li>
            Whisk eggs, milk, and gravy mix together in a bowl until smooth; pour over <br>
            casserole. Season with paprika.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the center of the casserole <br>
            comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let stand 10 minutes to firm up before serving.
        </li>
        
    </ol>
